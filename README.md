Welcome to the **C Programming Practice** repository. This collection serves as a foundational library of C programs, demonstrating core algorithms, mathematical computations, and logic building.

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository covers a wide range of fundamental programming concepts:

### 🧮 Mathematical Operations
*   `SumOfNum.c` - Calculate the sum of natural numbers.
*   `SumOfSquare.c` - Compute the sum of squares of numbers.
*   `multi.c` - Multiplication tables and logic.
*   `CountOfDigitz.c` - Algorithms to count digits in an integer.

### 📐 Geometry
*   `area.c` - Calculate areas of various geometric shapes.

### 🧠 Logic & Control Flow
*   `oddeven.c` - Determine if a number is odd or even.
*   `reverse.c` - Logic to reverse integers or strings.
*   `problems.c` - Various algorithmic problems and solutions.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run these programs, you need a C compiler (like GCC).

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushsail/C-prog.git
    cd C-prog
    ```

2.  **Compile a Program:**
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ```

3.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    ./output  # Linux/Mac
    output.exe # Windows
    ```

## 📚 Learning Goals

*   Understand memory management in C.
*   Master control structures (loops, if-else).
*   Develop efficient algorithms for mathematical problems.
